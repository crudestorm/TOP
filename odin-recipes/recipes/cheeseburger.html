        <h1>A GOOD Hamburger Recipe</h1>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 pounds freshly ground chuck, (at least 80% lean, a.k.a. 80/20)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>12 slices deli-counter American cheese</li>
                    <li>6 large burger buns, preferably homemade, toasted if desired</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix ground beef, onion powder, salt and pepper until just combined. </p>Do not overmix, or your patties will be tough.</li></p>
                    <li>Divide into six portions and form patties, without pressing too hard. They should be uniform in thickness.</p> Smooth out any cracks using your fingers. Make these right before you grill them, so they stay at room temperature.</li></p>
                    <li>Preheat your grill, grill pan or cast-iron skillet to high heat and add burger patties. If using a grill, cover with the lid.</li></p>
                    <li>Cook until the crust that forms on the bottom of the burger releases it from the pan or grate â€” about 2 minutes. Gently test, </p>but don't flip it until it gets to this point. When burgers lift up easily, flip, add two slices of </p>cheese to each, close lid if using a grill, and cook on the other side for another 2-3 minutes for medium to medium rare.</li></p>
                    <li>Remove burgers with a sturdy metal spatula and transfer to a plate. Allow to rest for several minutes, then transfer to buns.</li></p>
                    <li>Garnish as desired and serve immediately.</li>
